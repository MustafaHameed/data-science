/ root (top of tree)
~ home (personal files)

pwd (path to working directory)
clear
ls
ls -a (lists hidden and unhidden)
ls -al (lists details for hidden and unhidden)
cd dir (change directory)
cd (to home dir)
cd .. (to one level above)
mkdir name (make directory)
touch name (create an empty file)
cp file dir (copy a file to a dir)
cp -r dir1 dir2 (copy files from dir1 to dir2)
rm file (remove)
rm -r dir
mv file dir (move file from current wd to dir)
mv name1 name2 (rename)
echo (print)
date (print date and time)

Git
---------------------------
$git config --list (to see your user name, email ...)
Git (local) - GitHub (server)

1)create a repo on GitHub (server)
2)create a local copy
  - create a directory to store the repo (mkdir)
  - navigate to this dir (cd)
  - initialize a local Git repo in this dir (git init)
  - point local at server (git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git)
**git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git (to clone a existing repo)
3)Commit changes to local and server
  - git add . (adds all new files)
  - git add -u (updates tracking for files that changed names or were deleted)
  - git add -A (does both above)
  - git commit -m "message" (commit to local repo)
  - git push (push to server - GitHub)

Branches:
  - git checkout -b branchname (create a branch)
  - git branch (to see what branch you are type on)
  - git checkout master (switch back to the master branch type)

Pull request: merge in your changes into other branch (repo)
  - feature of GitHub
  - send request, others get notification

Markdown

R Packages:
----------------------------
  available.package() (obtain info about available pkgs on GRAN)
    a <- available.packages()
    head(rownames(a), 3) (show the names of the first few pkgs)
  install.packages("name")
  install.packages("p1", "p2", "p3")
  library(pkg-name) (load pkgs into R - no quotes!)
  search() (display functions that are exported by that pkg)

Type of Data Science Questions:
----------------------------
* Descriptive
* Exploratory
* Inferential
* Predictive
* Causal
* Mechanistic

Descriptive Analysis:
----------------------------
Goal: Describe a set of data
    * The first kind of data analysis performed
    * Commonly applied to census data
    * The description and interpretation are different steps
    * Descriptions can usually not be generalized without additional statistical
    modeling

Exploratory Analysis:
----------------------------
Goal: Find relationships you didn't know about
    * Exploratory models are good for discovering new connections
    * They are also useful for defining future studies
    * Exploratory analyses are usually not the final say
    * Exploratory analyses alone should not be used for generalizing/predicting
    * Correlation does not imply causation

Inferential Analysis:
----------------------------
Goal: Use a relatively small sample of data to say something about a bigger population
    * Inference is commonly the goal of statistical models
    * Inference involves estimating both the quantity you care about and your uncertainty
    about your estimate
    * Inference depends heavily on both the population and the sampling scheme

Predictive Analysis:
----------------------------
Goal: To use the data on some objects to predict values for another object
    * If X predicts Y it does not mean that X causes Y
    * Accurate prediction depends heavily on measuring the right variables
    * Although there are better and worse prediction models, more data and a simple
    model works really well
    * Prediction is very hard, especially about the future

Causal Analysis:
-----------------------------
Goal: To find out what happens to one variable when you make another variable change
    * Usually randomized studies are required to identify causation
    * There are approaches to inferring causation in non-randomized studies, but
    they are complicated and sensitive to assumptions
    * Causal relationships are usually identified as average effects, but may not
    apply to every individual
    * Causal models are usually the "gold standard" for data analysis

Mechanistic Analysis:
-----------------------------
Goal: Understand the exact changes in variables that lead to changes in other variables
for individual objects
    * Incredibly hard to infer, except in simple situations
    * Usually modeled by a deterministic set of equations (physical/engineering
    science)
    * Generally the random component of the data is measurement error
    * If the equations are known but the parameters are not, they may be inferred
    with data analysis

Definition of Data:
-----------------------------
Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of
items. (wiki)

Set of items: Sometimes called the population; the set of objects you are interested
in
Variables: A measurement or characteristic of an item
Qualitative: Country of origin, sex, treatment
Quantitative: Height, weight, blood pressure (usually hve an ordering on that scale)

Most important things in data Science:
------------------------------
* The most important is the question you are trying to answer
* The second most important is the data
* Often the data will limit or enable the questions
* But having data can't save you if you don't have a question

Confounding variable:
------------------------------
shoe size - literacy
age is the confounding variable

ways to deal with confounders:
    - if you can (and want to) fix a variable
    - if you don't fix a variable, stratify it
    - if you can't fix a variable, randomize it

Prediction key quantities:
------------------------------
Test/Disease    +   -
+               TP  FP
-               FN  TN

Sensitivity: Pr(positive test | disease) given you have disease
Specificity: Pr(negative test | no disease)
Positive Predictive Value: Pr(disease | positive test)
Negative Predictive Value: Pr(no disease | negative test)
Accuracy: Pr(correct outcome)

Summary experimental design:
------------------------------
Good experiments
    -have replication
    -measure variability
    -generalize to the problem you care about
    -are transparent
prediction is not inference
    -both can be important
beware data dredging
